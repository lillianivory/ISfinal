                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Education</h2>
                        <p>My name is Lillian Ivory, and I graduated from Olympus High School in 2022. I began attending Brigham Young University in 2022, and am currently enrolled as a Pre-business student. I plan on applying to the Marketing Program within the Marriott School of Business this summer, and am so excited to continue my education and persue osmething I love and enjoy.  </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Experience in Marketing</h2>
                        <p>My first experience in Marketing was doing an On Campus Internship for a company called the "Salt Lake Bride." I was able to manage marketing deliverables across four other interns by developing a launch plan, reviewing content quality, and ensuring the team edhered to deadlines. We updated wedding vendors on the website, and added photos to our new vendors. We also were able to increase the engagement of instagram by 381%, and Pinterest by 174%. We did this by developing and delivering  bridal social media content very consistently. </p>
                        <p>Next, I began working as a sales associate at a small boutique located in SLC, Utah last summer, where I was able to take on a large social media role. I now create visually compelling marketing content using Canva to align with the brand's image and showcase their products. I manage instagram stories and post around 24 slides per week to feature new or trending clothing pieces. </p>
                        <p>Finally, this summer I have the unique oppurtunity to move to London and support the production of marketing material and digital assets including video, sound recordings, images, and compy editing social media and webiste text for the National Army Museum. I will work along side as an intern for the marketing team at the company, and dive into the real world of marketing and assist what they need and want.  </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Work Experience</h2>
                        <p>Summer of 2022, I was able to work as an office administrator at Cottonwood Title Insurance Agency. My job was to supervise two branch offices to ensure common space remained clean, kitchen stocked, and the files were organized. I managed incoming and outgoing mail seven days a week, and greeted clients at office headquarters to direct them where they need to go.  </p>
                        <p>During my freshman year of college, I worked as at Bowls, a popular acai bowl spot in Provo, Utah. I helped serve and create the bowls for customers, and make sure all of the ingredients stay stocked. </p>
                        <p>Like I mentioned earlier, I worked at a small boutique in Salt Lake called "Koodeker", to assist and personally style clients for special events and wardrobe updates. I helped unbox new products and posted the new items to the company webiste weekly. Additionally, I replenished and organized the new inventory each day after closing to ensure the store remained customer ready.</p>
